## Introduction
Building a chatbot pipeline using the Transformers library involves several key steps, including data preprocessing, fine-tuning a pre-trained language model, and deploying the model for inference. This repository provides a detailed guide and code examples to facilitate the implementation of each step.

## Requirements
- Python (>= 3.6)
- Transformers library
- PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Flask (for deployment, optional)
- Docker (for containerized deployment, optional)

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transformers-chatbot-pipeline.git
cd transformers-chatbot-pipeline
```

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Proceed with the preprocessing, fine-tuning, and deployment steps as outlined in the subsequent sections.

## Preprocessing
The preprocessing step involves cleaning and formatting the input text data to prepare it for fine-tuning. Refer to the `preprocessing.ipynb` notebook for detailed instructions on preprocessing.

## Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model involves training the model on your specific chatbot dataset. Refer to the `fine_tuning.ipynb` notebook for detailed instructions on fine-tuning.

## Deployment
Deploying the trained model for inference can be done using various methods. For a simple REST API deployment, refer to the `deployment` directory. Instructions for deploying the model using Flask or Docker are provided.
